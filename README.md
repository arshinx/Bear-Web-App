About Flask
-----------

Flask is a powerful microframework which began as a joke on April Fools Day. Regardless of how Flask started, it is a very
powerful tooll for development of various types of applications. In our case, we will utilize Flasks extensive library and a
few packages to develop a web app.

The Bear Web App Project
------------------------

This project depicts a powerful way to use Flask. The end product contains an interface asking users to name their bear,
and saves the name therafter. Users are then redirected to another page, where they see the bear. The latter page contains
various elements including but not limited to Background colors, glasses, clothes and accesories to re-style and personalize
their bear.

Now, Let's begin!
